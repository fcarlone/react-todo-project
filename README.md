# React Todo App

### Built from my React boilerplate repository:
[GitHub React Boilerplate Repo](https://github.com/fcarlone/react-boilerplate "GitHub Repo")

This application allows you to enter a list of todos.  You can mark a todo as "completed" or delete the todo if you no longer need the todo listed.

### User authentication and data storage is accomplished with Firebase JavaScript SDK
If you clone this repo, please follow the instructions in the **.env.development.example** file.
You will need to create your own Firebase project and copy the configuration code snippet into **.env.development.example**.
